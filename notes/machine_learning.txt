#? What is machine learning?
Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics.
It's a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.



#? What is dataset?
A data set is any collection of data. It can be anything from an array to a complete database.



#? Data types:
  * Numerical
  * Categorical
  * Ordinal
  
  Numerical data are numbers, and can be split into two numerical categories:
    Discrete Data
      - numbers that are limited to integers. Example: The number of cars passing by.
    Continuous Data
      - numbers that are of infinite value. Example: The price of an item, or the size of an item
  
   Categorical data are values that cannot be measured up against each other. Example: a color value, or any yes/no values.

   Ordinal data are like categorical data, but can be measured up against each other. Example: school grades where A is better than B and so on.
